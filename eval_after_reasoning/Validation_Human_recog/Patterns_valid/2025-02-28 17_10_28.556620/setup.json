    "reasoning": "The original task is to fly through a gate associated with a person wearing a watch. From the FPV image, there are three framed areas, each highlighting a person, a red square gate, a blue triangular gate, and a green square gate. The person in the rightmost frame is wearing a watch on their wrist and is positioned near the green square gate. The other two persons do not distinctly show a watch. Considering safety and task精度, flying directly through the green square gate is optimal. The other gates are not associated with the person wearing a watch, and there’s no indication of a watch on the individuals by the blue or red gates. There are no apparent environmental constraints in the image.",
