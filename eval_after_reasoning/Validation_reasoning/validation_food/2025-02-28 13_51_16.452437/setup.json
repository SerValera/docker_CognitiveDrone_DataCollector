    "reasoning": "The task initially involves navigating towards a gate associated with 'healthy food.' From the visual data shown by the FPV image:\n- There are three gates colored green, red, and blue.\n- Each gate is associated with an image: the green gate shows a soda bottle (unhealthy), the red gate shows a dessert (unhealthy), and the blue gate shows avocados (healthy).\n- Based on the definition that avocados are considered a healthy food, the blue gate represents the target.\n- There are no environmental constraints such as obstacles or lighting issues visible in the image, so we can focus on selecting the correct gate.\n- Safety is ensured since the gates do not appear to have any immediate hazards from the image.",
