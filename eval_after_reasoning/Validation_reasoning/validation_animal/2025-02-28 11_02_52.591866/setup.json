    "reasoning": "The task is to fly through a gate with a pig. Analyzing the visual data shows three images structured with colored shapes indicating gates: a blue circle with a zebra, a red square with a pig, and a green square with a leopard. The command specifically targets the gate with a pig. The red square gate is the one containing the pig. There are no apparent environmental constraints or ambiguities in the imageâ€”each gate and its content are distinct and clearly identified. Thus, the command must involve flying through the red square gate.",
