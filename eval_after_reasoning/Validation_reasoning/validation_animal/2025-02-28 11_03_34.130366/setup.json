    "reasoning": "The task is to fly through a gate with a cow. From the visual provided:\n- There are three gates, each with a different color: blue, red, and green.\n- There are animals associated with pictures of cows.\n- The cow images and associated colors are:\n  - Blue circle near a cow on grass.\n  - Red square near a Eland (similar to a cow).\n  - Green triangle near a goat, which is not a cow.\n- Each gate has a different animal and shape above it, suggesting the color associates with the gate in use.\n- The goal suggests utilizing the cow, which could imply selecting the closest cow image for safety and simplicity.\n- The red square near the Eland, which is similar to a cow, would be a reasonable target since the other gates involve non-cow images.\n- I'll follow the red gate associated with the Eland assuming it to be a cow.\n- There are no visible obstacles or lighting concerns that affect the maneuver.",
