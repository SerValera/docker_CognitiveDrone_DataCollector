    "reasoning": "The task is to fly through a gate with a frog. Observing the FPV image, there are three distinct objects and three associated gates: a frog near a green circular gate, a wolf near a red triangular gate, and a dog near a blue rectangular gate. The original task specifies 'the gate with the frog', and the image shows the frog closest to the green circular gate. There are no ambiguities; the AND condition links the green gate explicitly to the frog. It's reasonable and safe to fly through the green circular gate with the object (frog).",
