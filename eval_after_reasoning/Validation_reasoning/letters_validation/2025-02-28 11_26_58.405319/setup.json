    "reasoning": "The original task is to fly through a gate associated with the letter 'L'. The image shows several objects: a red triangle, a blue triangle, a square labeled 'E', a tilted square labeled 'L', and a green square. The 'L' is on a tilted square, making it identifiable as the target gate. No contradictory or unclear visual information is present, and there are no obstacles mentioned in the task that would complicate the maneuver. The requirement fits the format 'Fly through <color, shape> gate with <max simplified name of object>'. The 'L' is distinct and identifiable, and no assumptions are needed that could make the task unsafe or unclear. No spatial relationships are specified beyond the association with 'L', and the image suggests that the 'L' is clearly visible and likely the most relevant object for this task.",
