    "reasoning": "The original task asks to 'Fly through the gate with six.' The FPV image shows three distinct objects with numbers â€” a red triangular object with the number 6, a blue triangular object with the number 5, and a green circular object with the number 9. The object with the number 6 is the red triangular object. Since the command is clear and visually confirmed by the FPV image, no adjustments are needed. I will ensure the command is in the appropriate format. There are no environmental constraints or ambiguities in this specific task.",
