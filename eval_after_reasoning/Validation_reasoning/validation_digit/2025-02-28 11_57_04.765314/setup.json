    "reasoning": "The task is to analyze the given FPV image and adjust the command 'Fly through the gate with six' accordingly. Upon examining the visual information supplied by the drone's camera:\n- There are three large numerical displays visible: '6', '4', and '10'.\n- Each number is associated with a distinct shape: '6' is paired with a square, '4' with a triangle, and '10' with a circle.\n- The shapes are outlined in different colors: the square (associated with '6') is outlined in blue and red, the triangle (associated with '4') is red, and the circle (associated with '10') is blue and green.\n- The task indicates flying through the gate with 'six', so the gate in question should be the square shape with the number '6'.\n\nNo ambiguities are present with this particular task since the visual representation directly links the number six to the square. The focus is purely on matching the number to the shape. Hence, the task involves flying through the gate represented by the square shape.\n\nConsidering all the elements and the safety of the command, the given FPV image fully confirms the logical path: the drone should navigate through the square-shaped gate associated with the number '6'.",
