    "reasoning": "The original task is to 'Fly through the gate with dhl'. Based on the FPV image:\n- The DHL logo is visible attached to a large green surface on the right-hand side of the image.\n- The image shows three circular objects of distinct colors (red, green, blue) that likely represent gates.\n- There is no immediate visual evidence of these objects being labeled with 'dhl'.\n- However, the DHL logo's presence could imply that the drone needs to approach this surface as part of the task.\n- The green circular object/gate is closest in alignment with the DHL logo, suggesting it might be the intended gate.\n- Since there’s no direct connection between the gates and the DHL logo shown within the image, I will need to make a reasonable assumption.\n- A safe and feasible action would be to align the drone with the DHL logo and fly towards the associated green gate.\n- I’m assuming the green gate is the one intended for the task due to its proximity to the DHL logo, as there is no other direct link between DHL and the red/blue gates.",
