    "reasoning": "Restating the task with the given image's context: The指令 is to navigate through a gate related to an 'android_1'. Visually, there are multiple objects: red Coca-Cola, green Starbucks, a green Android figure (android_1), and a few gates—blue triangle, red square, and green triangle. To resolve the ambiguity: \n1. The 'android_1' is in the context of the green Android figure.\n2. There is a green triangle close to the Android figure, which logically should be the gate related to the 'android_1'.\n3. The other gates have no direct connection to the Android figure. \n4. The task requires the drone to interact with specific gates associated with objects.\n5. No safety hazards are directly visible in the image with respect to gates.\n\nTherefore, the task should be adjusted to focus on the green triangle gate linked with the Android figure.",
