    "reasoning": "The task involves flying through a gate with a number that equals 5+1, which simplifies to 6. Analyzing the image:\n- There are three gates, each marked with numbers 6, 7, and 8.\n- Each gate is associated with a shape and color: the gate with '6' has a circle (blue), '7' has a square (red), and '8' has a triangle (green).\n- The goal is to identify the gate labeled with 6, as 5+1 equals 6.\n- The gate with '6' is clearly visible and appears to be on the left side of the image.\n \nGiven the clear visibility and the math calculation: 5+1 is 6, there are no ambiguities in this task. The command should direct the drone to fly through the correct gate while adhering to safety and feasibility.",
