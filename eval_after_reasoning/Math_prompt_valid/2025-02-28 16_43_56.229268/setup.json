    "reasoning": "The task involves flying the drone through a specific gate that corresponds to the number 8+1, which equals 9. From the FPV image, we observe three distinct regions with numbers and colored shapes underneath: a red 1 with a red square, a red 9 with a green circle, and a white 5 with a blue triangle. There is a direct association between '9' and the mathematical sum indicated in the task description. The instruction is clear, with the number 9 gate identified by a green circle. There are no visible overlaps or ambiguities in this representation. Hence, the requirement is to fly through the green gate associated with number 9 to satisfy the task goal.",
