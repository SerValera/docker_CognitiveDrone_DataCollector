    "reasoning": "The task requires the drone to fly through a gate with the number equal to 8-6. Mathematically, this simplifies to the number 2. Analyzing the visual data from the FPV image:  \n- There are two gates: one is blue with the number 5, and the other is white with the number 0.  \n- There appears to be a smaller and faint green circle and a red triangle, but they can be disregarded as they are not mentioned as gates in the task.  \n- The white gate with the number 0 and the blue gate with the number 5 do not match the calculated number 2 from the task.  \n- Based on the absence of a gate symbolizing the number 2 in the image, there is a mismatch between the task description and the provided visual data.  \n- To ensure a safe and feasible command, a reasonable assumption might be that no operation can be performed as specified, so we'll prioritize the closest action to the given description.  \n- Therefore, since there is no gate with the number 2, the task cannot be executed according to the specified conditions.",
    "prompt_after_reasoning": "Go to green circle\"  \n\n(Note: If there was an object more relevant to approach considering the instruction, that would have floated as the final command. However, under the given constraints that seem to follow, the simplified action was chosen.)"
