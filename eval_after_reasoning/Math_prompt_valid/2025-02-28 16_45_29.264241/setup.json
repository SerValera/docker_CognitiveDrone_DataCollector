    "reasoning": "The original task is to 'Fly through the gate with number equal 0+8.' From the visual data, we can see three objects labeled numerically: 7, 8, and 6. The '0+8' operation simplifies to 8. Therefore, the task requires flying through the gate with the number 8.\n\nAnalyzing the image:\n- The numbers 7, 8, and 6 each appear above their corresponding symbols/shapes. The number 8 is above a green square.\n- There are colored shapes below each number: a red circle, a green square, and a blue triangle.\n\nFrom this analysis:\n- The gate associated with number 8 is likely represented by the green square.\n- The command should involve 'flying through' the green square gate, aligned with the computed target number.\n\nAmbiguities:\n- The term 'gate' is not a visible structure per se but is represented by the shapes, which act as gate markers.\n- The command is feasible and safe as it directly involves flying towards a specific visual marker with no apparent obstacles in the direct path.\n\nTherefore, the task can be simplified to a clear command focusing on the green square associated with the number 8.",
