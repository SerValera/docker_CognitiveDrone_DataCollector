    "reasoning": "The task is to fly through the gate with the number 9-8, which is interpreted as the number equivalent to 9 minus 8, thus the gate with number 1 is the correct target. From the FPV image: \n- There are three gates with numbers: 2 (green triangle), 8 (blue circle), and 1 (red square).\n- The correct gate is the one with the number 1, which is highlighted with a red square.\n- There are no environmental constraints, such as obstacles or lighting conditions, visible in the image.\n- The command should focus on navigating the drone through the gate with the number 1, simplifying the task to ensure safety and clarity.",
